# Getting started

## Browser (chrome) shortcuts:

ctrl+shift+i: open "Elements" in dev tools
ctrl+shift+j: open "Console" tab in dev tools

## Running JavaScript

-- we can run JS on the browser's console by which we will have access to the page we are on.
-- also we cn run it in `Script`
`` <script> console.log("hello world") ``

Always try to have your `script` tag before the closing `body` tag, because we can access the HTML elements written above the `script` tag as they are above the JS.
